# Infinity Roll
This is my first Game Jam. It was a solo effort in order to make a game which has only one button. While some people made games relating to a button inside the game, my game has only one control: The Space Bar Button.

In this game, you control a ball and make it jump over obstacles, collecting coins, and avoiding walls. If you get pushed off the left side, it's game over. There are some "Fun Facts" in the game too.
